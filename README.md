# Welcome to Modern UI Charts for UWP

This project is taken from 
https://github.com/svn2github/ModernUIChart


I have decided to port this project to UWP because the author did a great job building Charts and lack of controls about charts  for Universal Windows Applications.

This project provides a small library to display charts in **Modern UI Style** for UWP Apps

**This version supports:**

 - ColumnChart (ClusteredColumnChart, StackedColumnChart, StackedColumnChart100Percent)
 - PieChart (PieChart and Dognut)
 - BarChart (ClusteredBarChart, StackedBarChart, StackedBarChart100Percent)
 - Doughnut Chart
 - Radial Gauge Chart

**Current Features (from the original Project)**

 - Dynamic binding of data
 - Animation after loading and after changes to underlying data
 - Custom Color Palette
 - Hidable Title and Legend
 - Switchable series
 - Configurable font size
